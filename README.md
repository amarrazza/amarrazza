### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Web Developer capable of building user interfaces, databases, and the requests made between them using React, Axios, Node, HTML, CSS, and more. I'm currently seeking a Full Stack Web Developer, Front End Developer, or UI Engineer role, at a fast-paced and innovative company.

Below you will see some of my projects ranging from NFT community hubs to digital recipe cookbooks! I enjoy applying my technical skills alongside my personal interests to create applications that people find useful. I have found the best way to motivate myself and continue learning is when the software I build has real users, and so that's exactly what I plan to do.
